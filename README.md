Product Vision:

FlickPick is a web platform that reduces the time a user wastes perusing a streaming service by giving a movie recommendation tailored to a userâ€™s taste.
There are unlimited amounts of movie options which may cause an user to be lost or confused about what to look for. But, the problem is solved because we are introducing a fun and interactive questionnaire that allows users to finally find pick the right movie in time and with ease. Flickpick comes to the rescue, now enjoy spending more time watching than searching.
